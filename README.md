This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Grocery Shopping App

As a final project, I've made a Grocery Shopping App. As a user, I will be able to search for a type of food that I am in the mood for. Using a recipe API, the app will return a list of relevant recipes. If I'm in the mood for a particular meal, I can add this ingredients required to make it into my `shopping list`.

Using react-router, I will have the ability to navigate to the shopping list. In the shopping list, I will have a list of ingredients I need to get. If I don't need a particular ingredient, or if I've already gotten it, I can remove a specific item from the list. Additionally, if I'd like to wipe out my entire list, I can also do that with a button.
